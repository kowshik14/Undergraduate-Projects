# Undergraduate Academic Project

Welcome to my **Undergraduate's Project Portfolio** repository! This repository contains all the key projects, research work, and implementations I developed during my **B.Sc. in Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **Khulna University of Engineering & Technology**, Khulna, Bangladesh.

## Projects

### [Regulated DC Dual Power Supply](link_to_project_folder)  
Designing a DC dual power supply that is capable of providing constant as well as variable output voltage to a definite positive (+12V) and negative (-12V) range. This power supply has protections in various cases like over voltage, under voltage, short circuit, etc. The project was developed with basic active & passive electronic components such as Transformers, Diodes, Zener Diodes, Capacitors, Resistors, Op-amps, Adjustable regulator IC, Transistors, Relay, etc.  

### [Designing & Implementation of Low Pass Filter](link_to_project_folder)  
A second order low pass butter-worth filter. The hardware circuitry of this project is capable of reducing the high frequency in audio speakers, smoothing data signals etc. This low-cost project is developed with resistors, capacitors & an op-amp only.  

### [Smart Emergency Vehicle Control System](link_to_project_folder)  
The project is an Arduino-based vehicle control system to avoid collision or accident with any objects or vehicles. The speed of the car is reduced when any things or vehicles come up warning distance and gives the car driver warning. This project is developed with an Arduino, sonar sensors, motors, motor drivers, LEDs, and buzzers.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to my academic advisors, peers, and collaborators who contributed to the success of these projects. Special thanks to **Khulna University of Engineering & Technology** for providing the platform to carry out this research.
