# Undergraduate Academic Project

Welcome to my **Undergraduate's Project Portfolio** repository! This repository contains all the key projects, research work, and implementations I developed during my **B.Sc. in Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **Khulna University of Engineering & Technology**, Khulna, Bangladesh.

## Projects

### [Feature Extraction and Classification of Elctrooculogram (EOG) signal by using RNN for HCI](https://github.com/kowshik14/Undergraduate-Projects/tree/main/EOG-RNN-FeatureExtraction)  
The project represents my undergraduate thesis work, focusing on the development of a system to identify four directional eye movements using Electrooculography (EOG) signals. The project utilizes MATLAB for essential preprocessing tasks, including signal denoising, baseline drift mitigation, and feature extraction. For the classification phase, Python 3.7 is employed, leveraging Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow within the Google Colab environment. By analyzing time-domain features, the study evaluates the performance of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based deep learning algorithms. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining feature extraction with deep learning techniques for accurate classification of EOG signals, contributing to advancements in human-computer interaction.  

This research has been published in a Scopus-indexed journal. If you're interested, feel free to read it!

### [PizzaPalace - A Full-Stack Pizza Restaurant Website](https://github.com/kowshik14/Pizza-Resturant-Website/tree/master)  
Developed a dynamic restaurant website enabling customers to order food online, like pizza üçï, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript for the frontend, along with ASPX.NET, SQL, C# Server for backend processing. The platform includes user authentication, real-time menu updates, and an admin dashboard for managing orders efficiently.  

### [Regulated DC Dual Power Supply](https://github.com/kowshik14/Undergraduate-Projects/tree/main/DC-Dual-Power-Supply)  
Designing a DC dual power supply that is capable of providing constant as well as variable output voltage to a definite positive (+12V) and negative (-12V) range. This power supply has protections in various cases like over voltage, under voltage, short circuit, etc. The project was developed with basic active & passive electronic components such as Transformers, Diodes, Zener Diodes, Capacitors, Resistors, Op-amps, Adjustable regulator IC, Transistors, Relay, etc.  

### [Designing & Implementation of Low Pass Filter](https://github.com/kowshik14/Undergraduate-Projects/tree/main/Low-Pass-Filter)  
A second order low pass butter-worth filter. The hardware circuitry of this project is capable of reducing the high frequency in audio speakers, smoothing data signals etc. This low-cost project is developed with resistors, capacitors & an op-amp only.  

### [Smart Emergency Vehicle Control System](https://github.com/kowshik14/Undergraduate-Projects/tree/main/Vehile-Control-System)  
The project is an Arduino-based vehicle control system to avoid collision or accident with any objects or vehicles. The speed of the car is reduced when any things or vehicles come up warning distance and gives the car driver warning. This project is developed with an Arduino, sonar sensors, motors, motor drivers, LEDs, and buzzers.
